 * (`PUMAS_MODE_WEIGHTED`). However, for a tau projectile the default is to
 * randomise the decay location (`PUMAS_MODE_RANDOMISE`).
 *
 * Each simulation context natively embeds a pseudo random engine. A Mersenne
 * Twister algorithm is used. The random engine can be seeded with the
 * `pumas_context_random_seed_set` function.  Note that two contexts seeded
 * with the same value are 100% correlated. If no seed is provided then one is
 * picked randomly from the OS, e.g.  from `/dev/urandom` on UNIX.
 * Alternatively, a custom random engine can be used instead of the native one
 * by overriding the *random* callback.

 * Note that it must be set by the user before calling
 * `pumas_context_transport`.
 *
 * The *event* field of the simulation context allows to specify end conditions
 * for the Monte Carlo transport. E.g. a lower (upper) limit can be set on the
 * kinetic energy of the projectile in forward (backward) mode. The limit value
